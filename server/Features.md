### Notes
- Why sql over mongo
- How to inject drizzle db
- Connection-factory using dotenv vs using config service and having all configs in one place.
- Why usar nextjs solo para el frontend y no directamente react.

### To do
- Add event driven architecture to the rest of the modules. Handle the writing of the logging system to it.
